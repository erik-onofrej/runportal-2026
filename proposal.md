I'd like to create running web which will focus on running events / races - signup, results. Proposal schema can be following: There will be Event entity which can have one or more Runs. User can signup for a run. Each run can have running categories (for example: Juniors: 16-18y, Men 40-49y, Men: 50+). Event has EventSchedule, example: 8.00 - presentation of runners, 9.00 - start of 10k race, 10.00 - start of marathon. For each run entry fee can vary depend on sign up and payment date. Site will focus on runners in Slovak (Need to keep in mind when plannning how event location will be stored, for example there are districts and regions in slovak). Each event can have partners (sponsors), one or more organizers (need to track main organizer(s)). Events can have attachments. You can see here example schema form my previous project https://github.com/onofrej1/runportal/blob/master/prisma/schema.prisma#L260-L455 (line 260 to 455), but please don't stick to this schema, use your best knowledge and best practices to plan database schema. There will be page to find races with a link to see details and sign up link. There will be page to list (search) race results. I don't wnat to implement any payment process (most of the time there will be just info how to pay, bank account number to send entry fee). Please create plan.
